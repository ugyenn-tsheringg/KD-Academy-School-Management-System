# KD Academy School: Learning Management System
The KD Academy School Management System is a web-based platform that helps manage course enrollment, track attendance, and monitor student performance. It was built in two weeks, as part of my 'Web Design and Development' course project. The system focuses on being simple, secure, and easy to use, following the requirements in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
